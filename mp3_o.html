  a requirement for graduation.  I used my Macbook Air and the Application called Audacity.  My mp3 includes 3 songs, an audio recording, and various effects.  My tracks include
  “Ventura Highway” by America, “Horse with No Name” by America, and “Put Your Records On” by Corinne Bailey Rae.</font></span></td>

<td colspan="3" width="700" align="center"><p>I first began by editing my volume wave to stay between 0.5 and -0.5 
according to our mp3 directions.  Then I began editing my first song, “Ventura Highway” by America, for the introduction.  
I deleted parts of the song and duplicated the beginning two eight counts to allow for a background sound behind my audio 
recording of my voice (using “Edit” and selecting “Duplicate”).  I used to “Envelope” tool to create a fade in the music to 
allow for my audio recording could be easily heard over the background music.  I repeated the duplication and then used the 
“Time Shift Tool” to move the duplicates to allow for it to sound like it is repeating seamlessly.  I added the voice recording
 and used the split tool to separate it to add music in between.  I repeated the above steps with the songs “Horse with No Name”
  by America and “Put Your Records On” by Corinne Bailey Rae.  In order to allow for the seamless transition between songs and
   audio, I again used the “Envelope” tool to apply a fade in or face out with the volume waves.  At this point, once I had
    the overall audio that I wanted for the ePortfolio, I began adding effects.  I used the effect “amplify” and then
     “normalize” as instructed.  I also chose to add additional “Face In” and “Fade Out” effects to the last so that the sounds
      had a stronger fade and more seamless transition.  I also added an echo to the first track, “Ventura Highway.”</p>
